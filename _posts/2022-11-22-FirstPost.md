# **Hello world!**

So, here it is, the hello world tradition for good luck, we don't want this to turn into hell, if you know what i mean ðŸ˜…â€‹.

This is the first post in here. Not so sure why I created this in the first place, hopes are that this turn into something therapeutic for me. I discoverd that editing with markdown is kinda relaxing, also, sharing my thoughts alongside stuff that i like about technology in general was always fun, maybe here i can teach someone something new, or even just distract anyone that wants to run from life bad vibes.


## Plans 
Enough of talking about me! Here are my plans for this place:

- Tutorials
- Algorithm explanations
- Stuff i am studding
- Sharing hobbies
- Recommendations
- Reviews
- Tech News (?, ok, maybe not)
- Nerd stuff
- ~~Good jokes~~
- Anything interesting that may come in the future
 
I don't want this to become just a giant blob of random things, so i will to try to orient it to Computer Science and technology. If you like this, feel free to check more posts in the future.

> Nothing here is a rule, just plans, and plans change ...

## Recommendation

Just to say that this post had some content, my initial plan was to bring some Youtube channels that i recommend with Computer Science stuff, but i realized that it would be fun to do a post only for that. With that in mind, here's my new idea, recommend you this websites for you to have some fun:

This website will take you to another "useless" sites, but with a button, good luck.

<h2 data-toc-skip>InspiroBot</h2>

Nothing more interesting than pseudo-philosophical phrases with beautiful background to post on social media ain't I wright ? This one uses AI to create random images with phrases. If you explore it for some time you might discover a surprise ...

<h2 data-toc-skip>Flightradar24</h2>

<https://www.flightradar24.com>
